# MatheMagic
Mathematics database application I produced for practicing past paper A Level maths/further maths questions.
Please note: due to archive misplacement only an early rendition of this project is available (as implied by the "test" suffix convention).
 To run this - you will be required (due to static directory encoding - an issue I aim to eradicate soon) to place the Khalid directory (containing the question database)
 in your (Windows) Users folder on the C: drive.
 The program will then be runnable using MatheMatest.exe.
